# Taskmaster
this application help user to develop distraction free environment for user . 


### What this project does

This application is used to create a distraction-free environment so that we can achieve our goals more efficiently. Most of our time is spent scrolling the internet watching unwanted videos and playing games, this application restricts its users from completing their tasks only then will they be able to watch videos and play games. In short, if users want to chill they first have to complete their targets otherwise every one-hour application sends a prompt notification and the user has to complete the portion of the task to do the job in their normal manner and this task is divided into 12 fractions.

**### How this application assign any tasks **

To assign any task to a user, we first divide users into two groups: mentors and mentees. Mentees are the primary users or students who are working on their tasks, while mentors are the secondary users or teachers who monitor the progress of their students. Mentors have primary-key access, which allows their students to work on their devices in the critical-task stage. In case of an emergency, the mentor can grant this key access to their student, allowing them to work on in CTS on weekdays.
